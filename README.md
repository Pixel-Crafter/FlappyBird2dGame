# Flappy Bird 2D Game

Welcome to the Flappy Bird 2D Game repository! This project is a Unity-based clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, built for educational and recreational purposes. The game involves guiding a bird through a series of obstacles without hitting them.

## 🕹️ Game Overview

In this game, players control a bird that automatically falls due to gravity. The player must tap or click to make the bird fly upwards. The goal is to pass through as many clouds as possible without hitting them or falling off the screen.
